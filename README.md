## Features:
- Powered by Raspberry Pi Pico
- ANSI 104 layout
- Full RGB with NeoPixel LEDs
- Hot swappable
- South facing switches
- PCB mounted stabilizers
- 2 layer PCB
- I2C pinout for optional expansion

## NeoPixel LEDs

Each switch has a NeoPixel LED under it and each LED can be controlled independantly from one another. All of those LEDs are optional and you can use your keyboard without them.

## I2C

Next to the Raspberry Pi Pico there are 4 pins for the I2C pins. You can leave them be or connect something (small LCD screen or a rotary encoder) to add extra features to your keyboard.

## Notes

This project is preety much just a better version of my previous project [Dachshund104](https://github.com/TheMobas0/Dachshund104). I didn't want to build my previous one because the PCB was 4 layers it used Teensy++ 2.0 which is now discontinued making it very expensive. This one is diffrent because it has 2 layers instead of 4 and uses Raspberry Pi Pico instead of Teensy++ 2.0 making it a bit cheaper. Also the LED lightning is now better because of the wounder of NeoPixel LEDs.
